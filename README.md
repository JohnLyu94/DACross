# Tensorflow 2 Impementation of DACross

DACross(**D**ual-Flow **A**ttentive Network with Feature **Cross**ing) is a deep nerual network proposed for trip purpose inference based on trip chains. This repo includes its Tensorflow 2 implementaion.

For details, the paper, [A Dual-Flow Attentive Network with Feature Crossing for Chained Trip Purpose Inference](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.19322279.v1), is now accessible on TechRxiv.

As the paper is published, more codes and scripts will be available soon.
